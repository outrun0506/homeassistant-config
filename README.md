# Homeassistant Config

Hey @all,\
My whole house is running on [Homeassistant](<https://www.home-assistant.io/>)

Currently I'm running my setup on an Intel NUC NUC6I3SYK with 8 GB RAM and an 128GB Samsung EVO 850 M2.SSD - Enough performance for nearly everything.\
My setup is based on HASSOS

## Install Instructions for HASSOS on a Intel NUC:

Things ToDO/Planned:

- Documentation here on Github
- Rework whole HA - move to Integrations in Admin-Interface from YAML
- Homeassistant Config-Check via GÃ­thub Actions or via Azure Pipelines - Done
